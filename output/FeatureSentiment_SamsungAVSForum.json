Hopefully some reviews come out soon.   The F8000 does have a true 240hz processor. Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I\u0027ve been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don\u0027t think the active sets are good for vision, I\u0027m in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems).. So its a conundrum.. ",

Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn\u0027t greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved. ",

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you\u0027re right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won\u0027t look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It\u0027ll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change. ",

		"description": "   I am shocked with the contrast ratio numbers on the H8000 in that review. The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it\u0027s backlight uniformity. Now I\u0027m even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony\u0027s W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung\u0027s 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you\u0027re into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you\u0027re interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV\u0027s and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV\u0027s. ",

But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

High definition and blu-ray are nothing short of spectacular. I was watching football on Sunday and the hi def images were razor sharp and crystal clear. In close-up shots of the field you could almost count the blades of grass. I saw no motion blur at all especially when the camera pans during a long pass.  Regarding what Ken said about the \"fault finders\" once they find a fault then they can\u0027t unsee it. The best way to avoid that is to not look for it. Just sit back and enjoy what is surely the best(IMHO)1080p HDTV on the market today.  ",

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won\u0027t be disappointed.        I live in KC.  Do you know if they charge tax? ",

The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don\u0027t notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I\u0027m not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also.       Blu-Rays are so much fun. I can\u0027t wait to really see them for the first time.     Quote:        Originally Posted by AncientAlien      Has the 55\" been discontinued?

Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV.

Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you\u0027re right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won\u0027t look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets.

The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it\u0027s backlight uniformity. Now I\u0027m even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony\u0027s W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung\u0027s 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you\u0027re into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you\u0027re interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV\u0027s and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV\u0027s.

But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.

The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"?

Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread.

When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That\u0027s the understatement of the century.

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like \u0027Sleepy Hollow\u0027 can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set? I have been able to both improve the Directv picture and hide many of the artifacts by changing the settings on mine.

I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV\u0027s blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here.

I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture.

First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don\u0027t think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn\u0027t exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.

Per reviews I\u0027ve read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I\u0027m quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It\u0027s just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it\u0027s only one. Of course it\u0027s noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it\u0027s a beauty showing black images so that\u0027s really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn\u0027t keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don\u0027t know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I\u0027m a little OCD about it it\u0027s certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel.

I just got the TV on wen (last night). It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I\u0027m one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000...

Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I\u0027m hoping you will take my four points into consideration.

I just got the TV on wen (last night). It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don\u0027t need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

I believe the sale price was $1799 or somewhere in that neighbourhood. I managed to walk out of there with the TV and 4 year warranty for the $1799 price. I was pretty stoked...until I got home. The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn\u0027t going on any longer but there are still a few TV\u0027s on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I\u0027m happy.  Now who has some killer settings!?

I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

The only picture setting I don\u0027t like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me.

Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don\u0027t want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me.

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death.

I had the tv in my living room. To the right was a 5\u0027 glass door. I did not get much reflection from outside. I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting. Hope to finish the room with Dolby Atmos        Quote:        Originally Posted by captaino      I\u0027ve had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day.       AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don\u0027t like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven\u0027t tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren\u0027t happy then you\u0027ll know that you didn\u0027t give up easily.

Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000.

The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I\u0027m curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I\u0027ll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don\u0027t see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it\u0027s base design will not work in my bedroom.

At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left \u0026amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it \u0026amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago \u0026amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it \u0026amp; while the curve doesn\u0027t do much for me  when it comes to movies \u0026amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two \u0026amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models.

Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games \u0026amp; the brightness \u0026amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast \u0026amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings \u0026amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting \u0026amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I bought  UE-H8000 TV a months ago and almost from the day 1 this TV started rebooting all the time while watching it. The auto power shut off is not enabled. It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn\u0027t require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn\u0027t help.

Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I\u0027m having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I\u0027ve heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly?

Also, is there any issues with these TV besides flashlighting and clouding? Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I\u0027ve had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.

I have one that\u0027s perfect but it\u0027s a 46\" and I need one that\u0027s 55\" for our living room.  Didn\u0027t one of you return your set for minor clouding/flashlighting?   You knew the limitations so why did you exchange it?  You were after that perfect set and it appears you got it.

Honest officer, it was too dark to see anything.  I did, early on, reduce the backlight level to 10, IIRC, based on comments here...

I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don\u0027t know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told.

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days.

If I don\u0027t notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don\u0027t even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000?

I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it\u0027s supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don\u0027t forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4.

Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.

Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase.

Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don\u0027t like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 \u0026amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.  What do you think? Thank you!!!

It\u0027s better that a good tech replace the panel than receive a whole new TV.   Almost all clouding and flashlighting is caused by overtightening of the screws that secure the panel.  This tech probably could have got your existing panel looking good by loosening and retightening the panel screws to the proper spec all the way around.  Sounds like he did a good job installing the new panel.  If you have any residual clouding you can probably massage it out with a microfiber cloth.

Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn\u0027t get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn\u0027t bother me and I\u0027m fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won\u0027t feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I\u0027m quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn\u0027t be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don\u0027t recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn\u0027t not see it. So if its not readily noticable I\u0027ll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"ancientalien","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"tvs","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"months","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"alternative","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"folks","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"decades","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"lenses","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"curve","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"sense","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"yvmv","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"easy","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"chance","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"backlight","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"prescription","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"magnification factor","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"image","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      ","entitySentiment":[]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"    Regards, Ken (Retired) Denon AVR4520CI; 9.1 setup Samsung 55H8000 TS02; Samsung BD-F7500 (2014) Klipsch R-12SW Subwoofer (Looking to add SVS PC2000) LRC \u0026amp; RS \u003d Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s; Front height and side surrounds \u003d Polks ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"Ken (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"R-12SW Subwoofer (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"polks","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      Quote:        Originally Posted by Matt2026      For my old ears they\u0027re pretty good, 2 woofers and 2 wide range do okay, but having a subwoofer I plug into my Samsung Blu-ray player makes it much nicer..

Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv.

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There\u0027s usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It\u0027s usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there\u0027s a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck?

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I\u0027m looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I\u0027ve been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don\u0027t want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I\u0027m torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn\u0027t find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don\u0027t really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality?

Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don\u0027t like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) \u0026amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it\u0027s a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that\u0027s crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it\u0027s the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better.

Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I\u0027ve ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing.

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.

The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It\u0027s ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS\u0027. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it\u0027s still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I\u0027m selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can\u0027t deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I\u0027m seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung\u0027s in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don\u0027t play competitively so even 100ms doesn\u0027t bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they\u0027re not sensitive to blur. I\u0027d love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!

Burn in just isn\u0027t going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don\u0027t think twice about it. I\u0027ve had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It\u0027s entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out.

Happily it came with a TS02.  I\u0027ve been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender\u0027s Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.

The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D \u0026gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don\u0027t care for.

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it\u0027s hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren\u0027t obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room?

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode.

How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I\u0027m guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets.

Thanks for the response.  I looked up the H7150 thread and most people seem to have problems with the 75\" tv.  Is this your takeaway as well, or did I miss some posts?  Does anyone else with the H8000 want to Chime in.  I\u0027m wondering about viewing angles.  I live in a city rowhome/townhouse (which means a narrow house). The couch is probably about 6-8 feet away from the tv.  While I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll look great for the person right in front of the tv, what about 2,3, or 4 other people that might be watching the tv as well?

For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.    So we\u0027re on the same page: Smart LED feature \u003d\u003d \"Precision Black\" \u003d\u003d local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate \u003d\u003d software-based video processing. It\u0027s not really local dimming of the LEDs at all.   The US versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as Precision Black local dimming. The UK and Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming.   The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It\u0027s an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there\u0027s probably two different versions of the TV in Canada.   That AVForums H8000 review is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\" They seem to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective.   FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.

The review on avforums indicated:“The H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we\u0027ve measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn\u0027t make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn\u0027t notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive”. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year’s 55F8000, though it’s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it’s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled “Enabling Game Mode” provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU \u0026gt;System \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today.

Anything about uniformity is misleading since the U.S. Version has local dimming.   If you read the avforums review, you will find this statement:The only area where the H8000 showed any real weakness was in terms of its backlight uniformity, which was a little patchy in places, although this was only evident on very dark scenes when watching at night. However, we were reviewing an early production sample but, having now seen full production models, the backlight uniformity has been significantly improved. The overall uniformity for our H8000 review sample can be evidenced by the ANSI graphic below, which shows measurements for each of the black and white squares. The H8000 was pleasingly free of the two other common issues often found on LED LCD TVs - dirty screen effect and banding. These can be especially noticeable on football broadcasts, where the camera pans across the pitch or in areas of uniform colour such a sky, so we were glad the H8000 had no such problems.  This same review also includes this statement:The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests  Yes, it\u0027s a UK site, but it is obvious that uniformity (regardless of the country of origin or availability of local dimming) is very, very good. This is emphasized by this statement taken from a review of an American specification television:The strongest in the market LED edge backlight and black levels really give this Samsung an edge in picture quality over every other LED TV in the market. The 55F8000 has best in class color and contrast that create superior images and the light flow through the the LED backlights is amazing. Images on screen are crisp, and refined compared to some of the other LED TVs out there. The backlight does need to be kept in check because it has the potential to wash colors and contrast out. The safe zone for the backlight setting on this TV is around 70% of capacity.

However, we were reviewing an early production sample but, having now seen full production models, the backlight uniformity has been significantly improved. The overall uniformity for our H8000 review sample can be evidenced by the ANSI graphic below, which shows measurements for each of the black and white squares. The H8000 was pleasingly free of the two other common issues often found on LED LCD TVs - dirty screen effect and banding. These can be especially noticeable on football broadcasts, where the camera pans across the pitch or in areas of uniform colour such a sky, so we were glad the H8000 had no such problems.  This same review also includes this statement:The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests  Yes, it\u0027s a UK site, but it is obvious that uniformity (regardless of the country of origin or availability of local dimming) is very, very good.    I read the AVForum Review earlier this month so I didn\u0027t bother to re-read your link to it. They\u0027ve clearly updated the original review though. It sounds like uniformity should be good.

The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I’m looking forward to hearing from other owners.

I also like the upscaled standard definition TV (dish network), flesh tones could be improved but I have left the picture setting at movie. I had tried the recommended settings in the other thread here but they did not work for me. However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don\u0027t get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions.

It\u0027s been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can\u0027t stop watching / fiddling with it.   It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that\u0027s nothing new ... After changing to \u0027Movie\u0027 mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon.   Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry!   Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I\u0027m an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)    I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn\u0027t overly bad ... Just the same, I went to \u0026lt;Auto Motion Plus\u0026gt; under Picture --\u0026gt; Options and changed the setting to \u0026lt;Standard\u0026gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.    Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12\u0027 - I love it and don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever go to the movie theater again.     Just some facts and observations now ...   Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels   Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600}   Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding}   Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don\u0027t (yet) have a calibration disc so I can\u0027t be really sure of what I\u0027m looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet.   I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days.   One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that\u0027s what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh.   Last word - I watched a few minutes of \u0027Lawrence of Arabia\u0027 on Bluray - I guess they can\u0027t make \u0027em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents)   Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain\u0027t easy to walk away.

Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I\u0027ve been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don\u0027t think the active sets are good for vision, I\u0027m in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems)..

I never use the Smart Hub to begin with so getting the evolution kit for my F8000 is not something I\u0027m interested in. So if those are the only major differences then I\u0027ll be even more happy that I got the F8000 instead of the H8000. The F8000 blows me away with it\u0027s picture quality still to this day after over 8 months of owning it, it would take a colossal leap in picture quality for me to want another LED before OLED is matured and affordable.   I think the processor for Smart Hub is faster on H8000. Don\u0027t know for certain but I think it\u0027s double than F8000. Do you think there will be the same Samsung made TS01 PANEL in the H8000 since it\u0027s curved?

Contrast ratios have stayed more or less the same the last few years on the high end Samsungs. But if there is some sort of substantial increase in contrast ratio with the H8000 it may a reason for me to upgrade from the F8000.   I didn\u0027t read that it was a newer version than the F8000.. I just figured they\u0027re trying to compete with Sonys Triluminous but if the F8000 had it I\u0027m sure the H8000 is prob the same. I just think its a steep price for a 65in 1080p LCD in this day to be above the 3k price point (regardless of features). Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn\u0027t greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved.

Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you\u0027re right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won\u0027t look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets.

The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it\u0027s backlight uniformity. Now I\u0027m even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony\u0027s W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung\u0027s 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you\u0027re into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you\u0027re interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV\u0027s and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV\u0027s.

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.

Im still blown away with the clarity and sharpness of this TV. I did the firmware update to the latest before viewing any content. But I have to give big thanks to this OP for sharing his settings. The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"? I remember I bought a LG led, and that was was the worst Soap Opera effect setting I have encountered but there was a setting which allowed it to take it off. Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread.

When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That\u0027s the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can\u0027t, I\u0027ve already made up my mind that I\u0027m going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger \u0026amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there\u0027s some sort of workaround.

I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

I had the tv in my living room. To the right was a 5\u0027 glass door. I did not get much reflection from outside. I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting.

I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

I just got the TV on wen (last night). It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I\u0027m one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000...

Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I\u0027m having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I\u0027ve heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly?

Also, is there any issues with these TV besides flashlighting and clouding? Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I\u0027ve had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.

I just got the TV on wen (last night). It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don\u0027t need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

Per reviews I\u0027ve read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I\u0027m quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It\u0027s just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it\u0027s only one. Of course it\u0027s noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it\u0027s a beauty showing black images so that\u0027s really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn\u0027t keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don\u0027t know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I\u0027m a little OCD about it it\u0027s certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel.

I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don\u0027t know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told.

But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set?

At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left \u0026amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it \u0026amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago \u0026amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it \u0026amp; while the curve doesn\u0027t do much for me  when it comes to movies \u0026amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.

The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast \u0026amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings \u0026amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting \u0026amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

Only complaint is that one of the recent firmware updates screwed up brightness setting for game mode but it was tweakable and not such a big pain. Please take some photos of service menu if you can. But remember if you even just enter service menu without changing anything it will reset all your picture settings from normal user interface.

I bought  UE-H8000 TV a months ago and almost from the day 1 this TV started rebooting all the time while watching it. The auto power shut off is not enabled. It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn\u0027t require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn\u0027t help. Does anyone have the same issue or know how to resolve it?

You\u0027re a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I\u0027ve been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven\u0027t turn it down yet because I\u0027m working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it\u0027s not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!!

Has anyone ever bought what essentially sounds like an open box item from a 3rd party seller on Amazon?       Number one: I would never buy anything from a third party seller. Number two: If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn\u0027t. Number three: Do yourself a huge favor(if you can afford to)and only buy if it ships directly from Amazon. Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I\u0027m hoping you will take my four points into consideration.

I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I\u0027ve been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven\u0027t turn it down yet because I\u0027m working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it\u0027s not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!!

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV\u0027s blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I\u0027m viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that\u0027s pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that\u0027s it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..

Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I\u0027ve been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven\u0027t turn it down yet because I\u0027m working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it\u0027s not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!! I just couldn\u0027t believe you just could literally \"erase\" a stuck pixel!!!!!  Your post was so assuring and helpful!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!       Happy it worked out for you!  Now enjoy that beast.

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV\u0027s blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I\u0027m viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that\u0027s pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that\u0027s it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..       First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don\u0027t think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn\u0027t exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I\u0027ve said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV\u0027s on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.

I want a well rounded TV with a quality image for low lag gaming, movies, and 3D. This TV seems to be the best overall option. Need to decide if I should buy the 55\" at 2 grand or the 65\" at 2.7 grand for that enhanced home theater experience. I have to buy at PC Richards as I have some credit there. As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don\u0027t want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me.

So as I \"suffer\" a \"little\" OCD and couldn\u0027t find the correct  fit-all height for my TV and tried and tried a lot of possible  configurations and furniture I decided the way to go was to have the TV  attached to a TV mount. One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn\u0027t a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death.

Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don\u0027t notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I\u0027m not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also.

The cinema black feature is a godsend. Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that\u0027s killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I\u0027m curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I\u0027ll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don\u0027t see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it\u0027s base design will not work in my bedroom.

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have.

I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies?

Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4.

Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don\u0027t like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 \u0026amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.

I\u0027ve been looking at many different tvs over the last few months and I keep coming back to the h8000.  I don\u0027t necessarily like the curve but it\u0027s very subtle and the alternative doesn\u0027t compete with the PQ.       Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn\u0027t get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn\u0027t bother me and I\u0027m fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won\u0027t feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I\u0027m quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn\u0027t be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don\u0027t recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn\u0027t not see it. So if its not readily noticable I\u0027ll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.

I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I\u0027m going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired.

Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don\u0027t like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) \u0026amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it\u0027s a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that\u0027s crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it\u0027s the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.

The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it.

The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It\u0027s ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS\u0027. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it\u0027s still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I\u0027m selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can\u0027t deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I\u0027m seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung\u0027s in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don\u0027t play competitively so even 100ms doesn\u0027t bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they\u0027re not sensitive to blur. I\u0027d love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!

Burn in just isn\u0027t going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don\u0027t think twice about it. I\u0027ve had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It\u0027s entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out.

That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go.

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There\u0027s usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It\u0027s usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there\u0027s a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck?

Happily it came with a TS02.  I\u0027ve been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender\u0027s Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.

The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D \u0026gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don\u0027t care for.

Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv.

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I\u0027m looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I\u0027ve been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don\u0027t want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I\u0027m torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn\u0027t find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don\u0027t really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality?

BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don\u0027t get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions.

As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.    So we\u0027re on the same page: Smart LED feature \u003d\u003d \"Precision Black\" \u003d\u003d local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate \u003d\u003d software-based video processing. It\u0027s not really local dimming of the LEDs at all.   The US versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as Precision Black local dimming. The UK and Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming.   The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It\u0027s an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there\u0027s probably two different versions of the TV in Canada.   That AVForums H8000 review is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\" They seem to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective.   FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.

The review on avforums indicated:“The H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we\u0027ve measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn\u0027t make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn\u0027t notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive”. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year’s 55F8000, though it’s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it’s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled “Enabling Game Mode” provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU \u0026gt;System \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today.

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!

How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I\u0027m guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets. I have a Mits DLP that is starting to show signs of chip failure (specks/spots visible during dark scenes or when screen is blank/no input) so the 65 is looking like a prime replacement.

It\u0027s been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can\u0027t stop watching / fiddling with it.   It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that\u0027s nothing new ... After changing to \u0027Movie\u0027 mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon.   Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry!   Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I\u0027m an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)    I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn\u0027t overly bad ... Just the same, I went to \u0026lt;Auto Motion Plus\u0026gt; under Picture --\u0026gt; Options and changed the setting to \u0026lt;Standard\u0026gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.    Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12\u0027 - I love it and don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever go to the movie theater again.     Just some facts and observations now ...   Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels   Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600}   Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding}   Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don\u0027t (yet) have a calibration disc so I can\u0027t be really sure of what I\u0027m looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet.   I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days.   One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that\u0027s what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh.   Last word - I watched a few minutes of \u0027Lawrence of Arabia\u0027 on Bluray - I guess they can\u0027t make \u0027em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents)   Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain\u0027t easy to walk away.

The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I’m looking forward to hearing from other owners.

Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing)..

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you\u0027re right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won\u0027t look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets.

The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it\u0027s backlight uniformity. Now I\u0027m even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare.

And now Samsung\u0027s 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you\u0027re into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you\u0027re interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV\u0027s and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV\u0027s.

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.

The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"?

Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread.

Grrrr, if only Sony had made that Bravia in 120hz it would have been so perfect!       Actually I read somewhere about this issue with this Samsung tv someone tried gaming but wasn\u0027t happy with its  gaming mode. At the end there was a solution, I hope someone can chime in and help this fella out, because I can\u0027t seem to find where I saw the post, maybe it was on Amazons reviews or somewhere on the net. Don\u0027t give up on this tv just yet because of the PQ on game mode, there\u0027s definitely a solution to it. I haven\u0027t gamed on this tv yet, but planning to soon, so I too would like an answer to this.  Cheers!

When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That\u0027s the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can\u0027t, I\u0027ve already made up my mind that I\u0027m going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger \u0026amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there\u0027s some sort of workaround.

The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn\u0027t going on any longer but there are still a few TV\u0027s on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I\u0027m happy.  Now who has some killer settings!?

I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

I just got the TV on wen (last night). It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don\u0027t know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don\u0027t have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it\u0027s also the most money I\u0027ve ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don\u0027t even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I\u0027m one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000...

I had the tv in my living room. To the right was a 5\u0027 glass door. I did not get much reflection from outside. I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting. Hope to finish the room with Dolby Atmos        Quote:        Originally Posted by captaino      I\u0027ve had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

For gaming you don\u0027t need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

The only picture setting I don\u0027t like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven\u0027t tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren\u0027t happy then you\u0027ll know that you didn\u0027t give up easily.

Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I\u0027m having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I\u0027ve heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly?

I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.

At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left \u0026amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it \u0026amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago \u0026amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it \u0026amp; while the curve doesn\u0027t do much for me  when it comes to movies \u0026amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two \u0026amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul\u0027s TV \u0026amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) \u0026amp; they also have brick \u0026amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest \u0026amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games \u0026amp; the brightness \u0026amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast \u0026amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings \u0026amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting \u0026amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I bought  UE-H8000 TV a months ago and almost from the day 1 this TV started rebooting all the time while watching it. The auto power shut off is not enabled. It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn\u0027t require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn\u0027t help.

Per reviews I\u0027ve read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I\u0027m quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It\u0027s just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it\u0027s only one. Of course it\u0027s noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it\u0027s a beauty showing black images so that\u0027s really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn\u0027t keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don\u0027t know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I\u0027m a little OCD about it it\u0027s certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel.

Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day.       AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don\u0027t like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven\u0027t tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren\u0027t happy then you\u0027ll know that you didn\u0027t give up easily.        I\u0027m still debating.  I really don\u0027t want to give up the black levels and uniformity but the picture is driving me nuts.  I have a rule of thumb, if i have to fiddle with settings for more than 5 minutes to get a good picture then there\u0027s something wrong with the TV.  I\u0027ve had at least 10 high end and mid range tvs over the last 8 years, a few got returned, and the ones I kept took me 2-4 minutes to realize if it was good or not.

I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don\u0027t know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told.

You\u0027re a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I\u0027ve been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven\u0027t turn it down yet because I\u0027m working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it\u0027s not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!!

Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I\u0027m hoping you will take my four points into consideration.

As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don\u0027t want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on.

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like \u0027Sleepy Hollow\u0027 can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set?

But when I watch a movie via my computer(connecting like a second screen) I am not happy with the results at all. Its a bit choppy, nothing like the tests at the shop.

Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don\u0027t notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I\u0027m not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also.

First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don\u0027t think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn\u0027t exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I\u0027ve said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV\u0027s on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.

So as I \"suffer\" a \"little\" OCD and couldn\u0027t find the correct  fit-all height for my TV and tried and tried a lot of possible  configurations and furniture I decided the way to go was to have the TV  attached to a TV mount. One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn\u0027t a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.  I  installed with some professional help and words nor picture do justice  for how beautiful the TV looks. It looks like it is suspended in the  air. I can recommend this TV mount 100%.

As for how the H8000  compares to the M70, the H8000 will trounce the Vizio in color  reproduction and picture video processing but it can be argued that the  M70 has a more effective dimming scheme and it\u0027s a much better value.

The cinema black feature is a godsend. Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that\u0027s killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I\u0027m curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I\u0027ll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don\u0027t see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it\u0027s base design will not work in my bedroom.

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don\u0027t want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games \u0026amp; movie watching) I\u0027ve been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I\u0027ve seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don\u0027t notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don\u0027t even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it\u0027s supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don\u0027t forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don\u0027t want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games \u0026amp; movie watching) I\u0027ve been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I\u0027ve seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don\u0027t notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don\u0027t even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it\u0027s supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don\u0027t forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase.

Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don\u0027t like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 \u0026amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.

I\u0027ve been looking at many different tvs over the last few months and I keep coming back to the h8000.  I don\u0027t necessarily like the curve but it\u0027s very subtle and the alternative doesn\u0027t compete with the PQ.       Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn\u0027t get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn\u0027t bother me and I\u0027m fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won\u0027t feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I\u0027m quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn\u0027t be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don\u0027t recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn\u0027t not see it. So if its not readily noticable I\u0027ll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"ancientalien","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"tvs","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"months","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"alternative","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"folks","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"decades","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"lenses","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"curve","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"sense","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"yvmv","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"easy","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"chance","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"backlight","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"prescription","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"magnification factor","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"image","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      ","entitySentiment":[]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"    Regards, Ken (Retired) Denon AVR4520CI; 9.1 setup Samsung 55H8000 TS02; Samsung BD-F7500 (2014) Klipsch R-12SW Subwoofer (Looking to add SVS PC2000) LRC \u0026amp; RS \u003d Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s; Front height and side surrounds \u003d Polks ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"Ken (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"R-12SW Subwoofer (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"polks","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      Quote:        Originally Posted by Matt2026      For my old ears they\u0027re pretty good, 2 woofers and 2 wide range do okay, but having a subwoofer I plug into my Samsung Blu-ray player makes it much nicer..

It\u0027s better that a good tech replace the panel than receive a whole new TV.   Almost all clouding and flashlighting is caused by overtightening of the screws that secure the panel.  This tech probably could have got your existing panel looking good by loosening and retightening the panel screws to the proper spec all the way around.  Sounds like he did a good job installing the new panel.  If you have any residual clouding you can probably massage it out with a microfiber cloth.

Quite happy with it so far, but noticeable black uniformity issues unless Smart LED is turned on.  I run my blu ray player and my PC through my Denon receiver, through HDMI to the TV. When I name this source \"PC\" then switch sources on the receiver from actual PC to blu ray, the TV somehow knows these inputs are different and will save different picture settings for each. This is nice, and would be perfect if PC mode allowed Smart LED to be activated. I use my PC for games, and the flashlighting turns up more in games than it does in movies it seems (loading screens, etc.).  Otherwise, if I name that source on the TV \"game\" or \"AV Receiver\", whatever picture settings I set are global for that TV source, regardless if I change the Denon\u0027s source.

Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I\u0027ve been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don\u0027t think the active sets are good for vision, I\u0027m in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems)..

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you\u0027re right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won\u0027t look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It\u0027ll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change.

The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it\u0027s backlight uniformity. Now I\u0027m even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony\u0027s W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung\u0027s 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you\u0027re into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you\u0027re interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV\u0027s and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV\u0027s.

Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv.

Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don\u0027t like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) \u0026amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it\u0027s a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that\u0027s crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it\u0027s the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better.

As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing.

I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I\u0027m going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired.

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There\u0027s usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It\u0027s usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there\u0027s a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck?

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.

I really don\u0027t want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I\u0027m torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn\u0027t find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don\u0027t really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality?

The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It\u0027s ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS\u0027. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it\u0027s still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I\u0027m selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can\u0027t deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I\u0027m seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung\u0027s in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don\u0027t play competitively so even 100ms doesn\u0027t bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they\u0027re not sensitive to blur. I\u0027d love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!

Is this something I would really have to worry about?  Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that\u0027s unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it\u0027s displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker \u0026amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I\u0027m hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv\u0027s. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above.

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it\u0027s hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren\u0027t obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room?

Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that\u0027s unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it\u0027s displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker \u0026amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I\u0027m hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv\u0027s. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I\u0027ve had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven\u0027t ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I\u0027ll have to pass.  I\u0027m hoping someone can help.  Thanks much.       While it\u0027s technically possible to burn in a LCD panel, it\u0027s not going to happen. That language is there purely for legal purposes. Burn in just isn\u0027t going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don\u0027t think twice about it. I\u0027ve had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It\u0027s entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out.

Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it.

I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls.

Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500.       Hi Joseph,  This is a late reply but I just recently signed on with AVS Forums.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on my BD-F7500 and thought it did pretty well. The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D \u0026gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don\u0027t care for.

While H8000 is an edge based dimmer, samsung has a rather impressive implementation.

I also like the upscaled standard definition TV (dish network), flesh tones could be improved but I have left the picture setting at movie. I had tried the recommended settings in the other thread here but they did not work for me. However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don\u0027t get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions.

But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.    So we\u0027re on the same page: Smart LED feature \u003d\u003d \"Precision Black\" \u003d\u003d local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate \u003d\u003d software-based video processing. It\u0027s not really local dimming of the LEDs at all.   The US versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as Precision Black local dimming. The UK and Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming.   The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It\u0027s an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there\u0027s probably two different versions of the TV in Canada.   That AVForums H8000 review is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\" They seem to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective.   FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.

The review on avforums indicated:“The H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we\u0027ve measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn\u0027t make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn\u0027t notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive”. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year’s 55F8000, though it’s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it’s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled “Enabling Game Mode” provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU \u0026gt;System \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today.

The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I’m looking forward to hearing from other owners.

It\u0027s been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can\u0027t stop watching / fiddling with it.   It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that\u0027s nothing new ... After changing to \u0027Movie\u0027 mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon.   Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry!   Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I\u0027m an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)    I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn\u0027t overly bad ... Just the same, I went to \u0026lt;Auto Motion Plus\u0026gt; under Picture --\u0026gt; Options and changed the setting to \u0026lt;Standard\u0026gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.    Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12\u0027 - I love it and don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever go to the movie theater again.     Just some facts and observations now ...   Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels   Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600}   Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding}   Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don\u0027t (yet) have a calibration disc so I can\u0027t be really sure of what I\u0027m looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet.   I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days.   One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that\u0027s what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh.   Last word - I watched a few minutes of \u0027Lawrence of Arabia\u0027 on Bluray - I guess they can\u0027t make \u0027em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents)   Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain\u0027t easy to walk away.

UN65H8000FXZA, TD02 panel USA model, arrived this morning from BestBuy.   Vid system is simple config as follows: Display, Samsung UN65H8000 set DYNAMIC Blu Ray player, Samsung BD D6500 set output 1080P (this disables DB WISE on H8000) HDMI video cable, Aural Symphonics Aural HDMI 1.50 meter  No special audiophile power cable Line conditioner, APC Smart UPS 1500VA LCD RM 2U, overkill but I have several. Unit placed on cocktail table 21\" off floor, center of screen near center/middle, zero degree of my viewing angle on couch.   So sorry to say settings in previous thread posted by kwcanuck, is complete useless. Not trying to bash kwcanuck, Cheers to you kwcanuck! Loaded all setting exactly as specified by kwcanuck, he stated has not tried settings, not trying to jab him but, don\u0027t waste the effort to try loading all  into MOVIE memory as listed. Results in display mages that are high contrast grayed out, 100% no pop, no clarity, greyed out blacks, etc, zero sharpness. Nothing with these settings look anything but old CRT from 1980, nothing as expected with H8000. I prefer factory DYNAMIC with minor change below with blu ray 1080P source.    I did modify a few H8000 settings as follows, YRMV: SOUND, Amplify TV SOUND OUTPUT, Stand AMP CUSTOM, 5, 6, OFF CLEAR VU, High DYNAMIC, no other changes Source blu ray set 1080P (this disables BD WISE) I do not like DYNAMIC for OTA broadcast; will choose something at another time for OTA viewing.Today out of the box my interest was blu ray. My H8000 has no banding or other issues to image/LED display/image processing as tested over 9 hours.   Demo blu ray disc and chapters: Prometheus 1, 25, 35 Alice in Wonderland 6 Inception 11 Sky Fall 3, 11, 17 Attack of the Clones 26, 28 Avatar 1 The Hobbit 26, 34, 44 Ghost Protocol 10 I didn\u0027t demo any 3D yet. YouTube various vids streaming 4K, selected 1080p (from drop down box on streaming vid) Various moving animals Various cities like London high speed   My last display was LCD Samsung LN52a850 calibrated.   So... the H8000 with blu ray 1080p, YouTube Wi-Fi stream 4k in 1080p (drop down box) all vids demos IMO are stunning, easily reference quality. Clear image movement with very minimal artifacts, HQ color saturation, ultra clean \u0026amp; clear images, reference quality performance like Samsung display at 14 CES (Consumer Electronics Show exhibit) I\u0027m a CES attendee 29 years. I chose H8000 over HU9000 due to limited 4k content and, expect to buy a 4096k set sometime when both content and true 4k display at reasonable cost will release 4-5 years from now, tic toc.     screen shot from Samsung GS3, paused image looks superior to this image.

UN65H8000FXZA, TD02 panel USA model, arrived this morning from BestBuy.   Vid system is simple config as follows: Display, Samsung UN65H8000 set DYNAMIC Blu Ray player, Samsung BD D6500 set output 1080P (this disables DB WISE on H8000) HDMI video cable, Aural Symphonics Aural HDMI 1.50 meter  No special audiophile power cable Line conditioner, APC Smart UPS 1500VA LCD RM 2U, overkill but I have several. Unit placed on cocktail table 21\" off floor, center of screen near center/middle, zero degree of my viewing angle on couch.   So sorry to say settings in previous thread posted by kwcanuck, is complete useless. Not trying to bash kwcanuck, Cheers to you kwcanuck! Loaded all setting exactly as specified by kwcanuck, he stated has not tried settings, not trying to jab him but, don\u0027t waste the effort to try loading all  into MOVIE memory as listed. Results in display mages that are high contrast grayed out, 100% no pop, no clarity, greyed out blacks, etc, zero sharpness. Nothing with these settings look anything but old CRT from 1980, nothing as expected with H8000. I prefer factory DYNAMIC with minor change below with blu ray 1080P source.    I did modify a few H8000 settings as follows, YRMV: SOUND, Amplify TV SOUND OUTPUT, Stand AMP CUSTOM, 5, 6, OFF CLEAR VU, High DYNAMIC, no other changes Source blu ray set 1080P (this disables BD WISE) I do not like DYNAMIC for OTA broadcast; will choose something at another time for OTA viewing.Today out of the box my interest was blu ray. My H8000 has no banding or other issues to image/LED display/image processing as tested over 9 hours.   Demo blu ray disc and chapters: Prometheus 1, 25, 35 Alice in Wonderland 6 Inception 11 Sky Fall 3, 11, 17 Attack of the Clones 26, 28 Avatar 1 The Hobbit 26, 34, 44 Ghost Protocol 10 I didn\u0027t demo any 3D yet. YouTube various vids streaming 4K, selected 1080p (from drop down box on streaming vid) Various moving animals Various cities like London high speed   My last display was LCD Samsung LN52a850 calibrated.   So... the H8000 with blu ray 1080p, YouTube Wi-Fi stream 4k in 1080p (drop down box) all vids demos IMO are stunning, easily reference quality. Clear image movement with very minimal artifacts, HQ color saturation, ultra clean \u0026amp; clear images, reference quality performance like Samsung display at 14 CES (Consumer Electronics Show exhibit) I\u0027m a CES attendee 29 years. I chose H8000 over HU9000 due to limited 4k content and, expect to buy a 4096k set sometime when both content and true 4k display at reasonable cost will release 4-5 years from now, tic toc.     screen shot from Samsung GS3, paused image looks superior to this image.   Great post! I am loving this TV as well! Some people have stated its a F8000 with a curve... I went through 7 of those at Best Buy and I can say with certainty it is FAR better! I couldn\u0027t post a pic that shows the true quality of this panel either. lol Though I tried.

Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I\u0027m one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000...

For gaming you don\u0027t need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.

The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn\u0027t going on any longer but there are still a few TV\u0027s on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I\u0027m happy.  Now who has some killer settings!?

I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

Per reviews I\u0027ve read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I\u0027m quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It\u0027s just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it\u0027s only one. Of course it\u0027s noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it\u0027s a beauty showing black images so that\u0027s really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn\u0027t keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don\u0027t know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I\u0027m a little OCD about it it\u0027s certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel.

I had the tv in my living room. To the right was a 5\u0027 glass door. I did not get much reflection from outside. I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting. Hope to finish the room with Dolby Atmos        Quote:        Originally Posted by captaino      I\u0027ve had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn\u0027t for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I\u0027ll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I\u0027m looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn\u0027t look anything like any app I\u0027ve seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don\u0027t think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV\u0027s. I\u0027d like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I\u0027ve tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

You\u0027re a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I\u0027ve been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven\u0027t turn it down yet because I\u0027m working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it\u0027s not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!!

I\u0027ve never owned a Samsung before but decided to take the plunge after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  TV \u0026amp; movies look absolutely amazing on this thing.  But I bought it primarily to game on, and that\u0027s where I\u0027m running into problems.  When I turn on game mode, my heart sinks.  The picture quality very noticeably drops \u0026amp; the colors all become dull and lifeless no matter how much I play with the picture settings.  I know what GTA V is capable of looking like, as I\u0027ve played it for many months on my Sony, and it looks dead on this thing.  Terrible aliasing as well.  And while there\u0027s no real motion blur to speak of, the picture is still significantly jittery when panning.  Obviously I can turn game mode off \u0026amp; turn on the Clear Motion feature (which actually works beautifully), but then the input lag makes the game totally unplayable.  I hate to say it, but my old Vizio M series had a better game mode than this TV and the Vizio was 1/3 the price.  Of course the Vizio\u0027s picture quality wasn\u0027t nearly as good for TV/movies though.  I\u0027ve read through every post on this thread and am surprised nobody mentioned the noticable drop in PQ when switching to Game/PC mode.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get it looking decent?  I feel like for what I paid for this TV, it should meet my expectations--and at the moment, it does not.  If I want mediocre PQ while gaming, I\u0027d just go back to the Vizio and save myself hundreds of dollars.  And one other disappointing discovery so far: The Hulu app won\u0027t output 5.1 on the UN48H8000.  It did on my Bravia.  I called Samsung \u0026amp; they told me to call Hulu.

I\u0027ve never owned a Samsung before but decided to take the plunge after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  TV \u0026amp; movies look absolutely amazing on this thing.  But I bought it primarily to game on, and that\u0027s where I\u0027m running into problems.  When I turn on game mode, my heart sinks.  The picture quality very noticeably drops \u0026amp; the colors all become dull and lifeless no matter how much I play with the picture settings.  I know what GTA V is capable of looking like, as I\u0027ve played it for many months on my Sony, and it looks dead on this thing.  Terrible aliasing as well.  And while there\u0027s no real motion blur to speak of, the picture is still significantly jittery when panning.  Obviously I can turn game mode off \u0026amp; turn on the Clear Motion feature (which actually works beautifully), but then the input lag makes the game totally unplayable.  I hate to say it, but my old Vizio M series had a better game mode than this TV and the Vizio was 1/3 the price.  Of course the Vizio\u0027s picture quality wasn\u0027t nearly as good for TV/movies though.  I\u0027ve read through every post on this thread and am surprised nobody mentioned the noticable drop in PQ when switching to Game/PC mode.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get it looking decent?  I feel like for what I paid for this TV, it should meet my expectations--and at the moment, it does not.  If I want mediocre PQ while gaming, I\u0027d just go back to the Vizio and save myself hundreds of dollars.  And one other disappointing discovery so far: The Hulu app won\u0027t output 5.1 on the UN48H8000.  It did on my Bravia.  I called Samsung \u0026amp; they told me to call Hulu.  Called Hulu \u0026amp; they claim they don\u0027t even transmit 5.1.  Huh??  Then how was I getting surround sound all that time with my Sony?  Are you guys able to get 5.1 with Hulu at all?  Grrrr, if only Sony had made that Bravia in 120hz it would have been so perfect!       Actually I read somewhere about this issue with this Samsung tv someone tried gaming but wasn\u0027t happy with its  gaming mode. At the end there was a solution, I hope someone can chime in and help this fella out, because I can\u0027t seem to find where I saw the post, maybe it was on Amazons reviews or somewhere on the net. Don\u0027t give up on this tv just yet because of the PQ on game mode, there\u0027s definitely a solution to it. I haven\u0027t gamed on this tv yet, but planning to soon, so I too would like an answer to this.  Cheers!

When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That\u0027s the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can\u0027t, I\u0027ve already made up my mind that I\u0027m going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger \u0026amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there\u0027s some sort of workaround.

Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I\u0027m having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I\u0027ve heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly?

Also, is there any issues with these TV besides flashlighting and clouding? Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I\u0027ve had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.

This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn\u0027t disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn\u0027t make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don\u0027t even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven\u0027t tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn\u0027t much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that\u0027s why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( \u0026gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don\u0027t know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told.

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV\u0027s blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I\u0027m viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that\u0027s pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that\u0027s it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again..

As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don\u0027t want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us.

At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left \u0026amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it \u0026amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago \u0026amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it \u0026amp; while the curve doesn\u0027t do much for me  when it comes to movies \u0026amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two \u0026amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul\u0027s TV \u0026amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) \u0026amp; they also have brick \u0026amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest \u0026amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games \u0026amp; the brightness \u0026amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast \u0026amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings \u0026amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting \u0026amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV\u0027s blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I\u0027m viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that\u0027s pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that\u0027s it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..       First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don\u0027t think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn\u0027t exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I\u0027ve said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV\u0027s on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.

The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don\u0027t notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I\u0027m not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things.

The cinema black feature is a godsend. Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that\u0027s killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I\u0027m curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I\u0027ll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don\u0027t see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it\u0027s base design will not work in my bedroom.

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don\u0027t want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games \u0026amp; movie watching) I\u0027ve been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I\u0027ve seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don\u0027t notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don\u0027t even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it\u0027s supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don\u0027t forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don\u0027t want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games \u0026amp; movie watching) I\u0027ve been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I\u0027ve seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don\u0027t notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don\u0027t even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that\u0027s the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it\u0027s supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don\u0027t forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it\u0027s true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn\u0027t like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn\u0027t went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase.

Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don\u0027t like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 \u0026amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.

I don\u0027t necessarily like the curve but it\u0027s very subtle and the alternative doesn\u0027t compete with the PQ.       Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn\u0027t get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn\u0027t bother me and I\u0027m fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won\u0027t feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I\u0027m quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn\u0027t be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don\u0027t recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn\u0027t not see it. So if its not readily noticable I\u0027ll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"ancientalien","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"tvs","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"months","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"alternative","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"folks","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"decades","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"lenses","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"curve","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"sense","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"yvmv","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"easy","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"chance","sentiment":"Positive"},{"entity":"backlight","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"prescription","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"magnification factor","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"image","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      ","entitySentiment":[]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"    Regards, Ken (Retired) Denon AVR4520CI; 9.1 setup Samsung 55H8000 TS02; Samsung BD-F7500 (2014) Klipsch R-12SW Subwoofer (Looking to add SVS PC2000) LRC \u0026amp; RS \u003d Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s; Front height and side surrounds \u003d Polks ","entitySentiment":[{"entity":"Ken (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"Celestion 5s \u0026amp; 3s","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"R-12SW Subwoofer (","sentiment":"Negative"},{"entity":"polks","sentiment":"Negative"}]},{"link":"[]","type":"samsung-h8000-curved-tv-","description":"      Quote:        Originally Posted by Matt2026      For my old ears they\u0027re pretty good, 2 woofers and 2 wide range do okay, but having a subwoofer I plug into my Samsung Blu-ray player makes it much nicer..

As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing.

Will post pictures!       Congratulations. You\u0027re going to love it. I have the 55 inch and I couldn\u0027t be happier.

Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv.

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There\u0027s usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It\u0027s usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there\u0027s a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck?

Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I\u0027ve ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing. The curvature of the stand is greater than that of the tv itself so it\u0027s my thinking that it makes getting used to the curved screen easier.

Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk       Did the Flashlighting go away at all with Local Dimming on High?  The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it.

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I\u0027m looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I\u0027ve been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don\u0027t want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I\u0027m torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn\u0027t find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don\u0027t really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality?

Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don\u0027t like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) \u0026amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it\u0027s a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that\u0027s crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it\u0027s the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better.

I realize I can switch receiver to an input and get both via an HDMI, but TV wont allow it automatically without conversion that will create input-lag that will make video and audio suffer for different things(IE: video lag to great for games \u0026amp; Audio would not be HD to allow for proper streamed video).

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.

The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It\u0027s ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS\u0027. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it\u0027s still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I\u0027m selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can\u0027t deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I\u0027m seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung\u0027s in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don\u0027t play competitively so even 100ms doesn\u0027t bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they\u0027re not sensitive to blur. I\u0027d love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!

Is this something I would really have to worry about?  Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that\u0027s unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it\u0027s displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker \u0026amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I\u0027m hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv\u0027s. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I\u0027ve had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven\u0027t ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I\u0027ll have to pass.

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it\u0027s hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren\u0027t obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go.

I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls.

The Bad: It doesn\u0027t have as deep a black level as a plasma; it suffers from a slight red push; it has a reflective screen; Yahoo apps aren\u0027t very slick; and the remote sensor isn\u0027t very responsive. The Bottom Line: The Vizio M-Series offers a potent combination of excellent design, decent picture quality, and a pocket-friendly price.\u0027  You get what you pay for.  If your satisfied with a little less picture quality and apps, a little lower quality of the passive 3D image, a picture that doesn\u0027t pop like it\u0027s cheaper E-Series TV, then you are welcome to buy a lower quality set.

Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that\u0027s unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it\u0027s displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker \u0026amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I\u0027m hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv\u0027s. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I\u0027ve had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven\u0027t ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I\u0027ll have to pass.

Burn in just isn\u0027t going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don\u0027t think twice about it. I\u0027ve had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!

How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I\u0027m guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets.

As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.    So we\u0027re on the same page: Smart LED feature \u003d\u003d \"Precision Black\" \u003d\u003d local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate \u003d\u003d software-based video processing. It\u0027s not really local dimming of the LEDs at all.   The US versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as Precision Black local dimming. The UK and Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming.   The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It\u0027s an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there\u0027s probably two different versions of the TV in Canada.   That AVForums H8000 review is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn\u0027t include Samsung\u0027s Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year\u0027s F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\" They seem to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective.   FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.

The review on avforums indicated:“The H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we\u0027ve measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn\u0027t make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn\u0027t notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive”. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year’s 55F8000, though it’s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it’s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled “Enabling Game Mode” provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU \u0026gt;System \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today.

The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I’m looking forward to hearing from other owners.

I also like the upscaled standard definition TV (dish network), flesh tones could be improved but I have left the picture setting at movie. I had tried the recommended settings in the other thread here but they did not work for me. However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don\u0027t get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions.

I tested Gravity last night and the screen had no clouding and movie bars were jet black with no light bleed. I would have to say the micro dimming ultimate is a big upgrade over pro. I am using movie mode right now waiting for some calibration settings from others or from a review. Standard looks good too but may be a little over saturated for some.

It\u0027s been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can\u0027t stop watching / fiddling with it.   It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that\u0027s nothing new ... After changing to \u0027Movie\u0027 mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon.   Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry!   Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I\u0027m an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)    I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn\u0027t overly bad ... Just the same, I went to \u0026lt;Auto Motion Plus\u0026gt; under Picture --\u0026gt; Options and changed the setting to \u0026lt;Standard\u0026gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.    Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12\u0027 - I love it and don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever go to the movie theater again.     Just some facts and observations now ...   Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels   Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600}   Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding}   Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don\u0027t (yet) have a calibration disc so I can\u0027t be really sure of what I\u0027m looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet.   I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days.   One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that\u0027s what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh.   Last word - I watched a few minutes of \u0027Lawrence of Arabia\u0027 on Bluray - I guess they can\u0027t make \u0027em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents)   Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain\u0027t easy to walk away.

I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don\u0027t have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000\u0027s must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!
